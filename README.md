# Description
###### RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the "factoring problem". Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem. Whether it is as difficult as the factoring problem is an open question.[3] There are no published methods to defeat the system if a large enough key is used.
